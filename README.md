Fixed an issue where Duo requires two factor authentication for users logging into the incorrect site in WPMU, even if that user doesn't have a role that requires admin on any site in the WPMU network.

# Overview

**duo_wordpress** - Duo two-factor authentication for WordPress logins

Duo provides simple two-factor authentication as a service via:

1.  Phone callback
2.  SMS-delivered one-time passcodes
3.  Duo mobile app to generate one-time passcodes
4.  Duo mobile app for smartphone push authentication
5.  Duo hardware token to generate one-time passcodes

This WordPress plugin allows you to quickly add Duo's interactive, self-service, two-factor authentication to any WordPress login.
